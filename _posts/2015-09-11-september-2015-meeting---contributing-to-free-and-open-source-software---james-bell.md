title: September 2015 Meeting - Contributing to Free and Open Source Software - James Bell
---

This workshop will be led by James Bell, aiming to help both current developers
who use open source software on a regular basis to make their first
contributions back, and also to encourage anyone newer to see how easy
it is.

The meeting will be in [CodeBase](http://www.thisiscodebase.com), in Argyle House on the corner of [West Port and Lady Lawson Street](https://goo.gl/maps/ZuPgH). Start will be at 19:30, 20/08/2015; it will be in the Burgh Loch meeting room on floor L. This is the opposite wing to the normal Event Space.
