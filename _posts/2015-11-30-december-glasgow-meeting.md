Come along to [tictoc][]’s office on [Newton Terrace][] ([directions][]) on
[**Thursday, 3 December** at **18:30**][calendar] for the next Glasgow
Ruby meetup!

We’ll use [Lean Coffee][] to lead the conversation again, which means
plenty of opportunity to ask questions, share ideas, and take part in
some lively discussion.

We’re in a better location for practical stuff this month, so bring
along a laptop if you would like to try some exercises, get help with
something specific, or show off some code.
