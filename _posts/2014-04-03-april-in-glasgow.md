April in Glasgow will see [Colin Gemmell](https://twitter.com/colin_gemmell) talking about the go language.

__Talk Description:__

Go faster applications

Ruby is a great programming language to write expressive, easy to read code that has thousands apon thousands of libraries to choose from so you don't have to write any code.

But Ruby has one major issue, it is slow language and it comes to a point where you need to augment your Ruby code with another languge. Github used Erlang, Twitter used Scala but for me the choice is Go.

In this talk I'll look at why I've Go over other programming languages, what's been gained, what's been lost and how you can integrate Go applications with existing Ruby apps.
