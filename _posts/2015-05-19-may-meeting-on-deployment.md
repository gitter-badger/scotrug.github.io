title: May 2015 Meeting on Deployment
---

This month's meeting will be at 19:30 on Thursday 21 May, in a new location. As FreeAgent are moving offices, we will be (at least for now) moving to [CodeBase](http://www.thisiscodebase.com), in Argyle House on the corner of [West Port and Lady Lawson Street](https://goo.gl/maps/ZuPgH). Head to floor M (top floor) and you will be directed to the meeting in the Blackford Hill Meeting room (not actually on Blackford Hill).

This month's topic will be deploying Rails Apps. What is everyone using to deploy Rails Apps these days (apart from Heroku)? What are the pros, cons, and tips?
