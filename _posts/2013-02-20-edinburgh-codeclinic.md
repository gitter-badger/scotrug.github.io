title: Code clinic on Thursday 21st Feb, in Edinburgh
---

By popular demand, February's ScotRUG is all about the codez. As discussed at last month's meeting, many people are coding projects in isolation and others want to get an outside look. Bring your code along for *constructive* ideas on how it might be better and advice on those tricky problems.

All discussion will be under [FriendDA](http://friendda.org) terms.  Usual place ([FreeAgent](http://www.freeagent.com/company/contact-us)), usual time (19:30).
