title: Glasgow September ScotRUG now with added refactoring - 06 September 2012
---

Hi all

Unfortunately T.J. Sheehy has come down with something and is unable to speek at tomorrow nights Ruby Group.

But no worries, instead we will be doing a refactoring kata. So bring along your laptops and get some good practice in refactoring your code to be a happy developer.

As usual it will all take place at [SocietyM](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=societyM+glasgow&ll=55.866125,-4.254284&spn=0.006971,0.01929&hq=societyM&hnear=Glasgow,+Glasgow+City,+United+Kingdom&t=h&z=16) starting at 7pm.

Thanks as always to [New Context](http://newcontext.com) for sponsoring the venue.
