title: December ScotRUG
---

December ScotRUG is being held early and at a different location. It is at Cargo, at 129 Fountain Bridge, EH3 9QG; google map is [here](http://g.co/maps/k8d5r).

We will start at 18:00 for Ruby chats, which will include a Ruby Quiz with a special prize.  At 19:00 those sufficiently ticketed will join the Edinburgh Startup Christmas party in the same venue.  Tickets can be bought [here](http://edinburghstartupxmas.eventbrite.co.uk/?utm_source=eb_email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=event_reminder&utm_term=event_title&ebtv=C), though at 11:00 on the 15th there was only one ticket remaining. Use the code 'timewarp' to get a bit of cash off, if you are fast enough.
