We are very pleased to announce that [Stephen Best (Bestie)](https://twitter.com/thebestie) will be travelling all the way from London especially to speak to us and as a special treat we'll be putting on some pizza and refreshments!



__Talk Description:__

Most of us have heard the vague, hand waving spiel about why DI is important for writing flexible, reusable code, a little harder to come by are examples of how one actually goes about doing it in a (cost) effective manner.


Rather than a dry introduction to DI, this talk will be packed full of code examples demonstrating practical techniques you can start using straight away, no gems, meta-programming or magic required. We'll also explore how you might persuade your Rails app to benefit from DI.


__About Stephen:__

Bestie is a London based Ruby / Javascript / XP contractor, committed to software craftsman and OO design obsessive.
