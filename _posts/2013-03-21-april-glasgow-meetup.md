title: Glasgow 4th April,  2013 - Joe finally gets it....
---

For March, [Joe Wright](https://twitter.com/joejag) what he has learned over the last 6 months.

Joe likes to think about how and why he does things, he doesn't always understand what he's doing, but he's good at looking competent. Come to ScotRUG to hear about what Joe learned over the last 6 months about SOLID, Git, regex and tooling choice while moving from looking competent to finally getting it.

18:30, for 19:00 start at the [SocietyM](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=societyM+glasgow&ll=55.866125,-4.254284&spn=0.006971,0.01929&hq=societyM&hnear=Glasgow,+Glasgow+City,+United+Kingdom&t=h&z=16)

As always a big thanks to [Neo](http://neo.com) for sponsoring the venue.
