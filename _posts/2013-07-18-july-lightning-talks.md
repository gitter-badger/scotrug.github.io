title: Edinburgh July 18 Lightning talks
---

We'll be back at our usual Edinburgh haunt of FreeAgent Towers in July for a series of fun-fun lightning talks.

John Daniels will be talking to us about private clouds.

Phillip Robers will be talking about dropping the asset pipeline for grunt and browserify.

Ryan Stenhouse will be talking about Twillio.

There's still a couple of slots left if anyone else wants to speak, just hit up the mailing list.

See you all there at 1930!
