title: Edinburgh July 18 Lightning talks
---

We'll be back at our usual Edinburgh haunt of FreeAgent Towers in July for a series of fun-fun lightning talks.

John Daniels will be talking to us about private clouds.

Ryan Stenhouse will be talking about Twillio.

Michael Carruthers will be talking about DTrace and Ruby.

There's still a couple of slots left if anyone else wants to speak, just hit up the mailing list.

See you all there at 1930!
