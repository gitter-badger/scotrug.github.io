title: Brain Rules by Iain Watt - Thursday 4th October 2012 Glasgow meeting
---

For the October meetup [Iain Watt](http://twitter.com/wattid) will be expanding on his Scot Ruby Conf lightening talk.

###Bio:
Being brought up in the 70's on a diet of Horizon & Tomorrows World I was always going to be interested in tech. I got my first proper hands-on exposure to tech with a BBC micro and haven't looked back since. IBM and Compaq paid me to play with robotics, material handling systems, and manufacturing data collection & reporting systems - to build new stuff or to make things better. Fortunately I love to learn so that I can build new stuff or make things better but I hate it when something (particularly IT) doesn't work the way I want it to.

###Talk:
"The most important book you've never read, or possibly even heard of" I'll introduce you to a handful of what Dr. John Medina, a developmental molecular biologist and affiliate Professor of Bioengineering at the University of Washington School of Medicine, intriguingly terms "Brain Rules".  In the book Brain Rules: 12 Principles for Surviving and Thriving at Work, Home, and School, Medina explains, why we might want to re-evaluate our approach to our environments and to our practices in education, at work and at home to get the best from the most powerful tool we have at our disposal - our brain - and to harness the latest research findings to improve our learning capabilities. If you're in any way interested in learning about learning and getting better at the things that interest you, come along to hear my talk. Hopefully I will convince you to go buy the book.  Is it "The most important book you've never read, or possibly even heard of"?  Probably.
