title: June 2015 - Go and Elixir/Phoenix for Rubyists
---

We will be taking a look at Web development using the [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org) web framework for [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org) and also [Go](http://golang.org). Presentations by [Paul Wilson](https://twitter.com/paulanthonywils) and [Colin Gemmell](https://twitter.com/colin_gemmell)

As FreeAgent are moving offices, we will be (at least for now) moving to [CodeBase](http://www.thisiscodebase.com), in Argyle House on the corner of [West Port and Lady Lawson Street](https://goo.gl/maps/ZuPgH). Head to floor M (top floor) and you will be directed to the meeting in the Blackford Hill Meeting room (not actually on Blackford Hill).
