> No matter what they tell you, it's always a people problem- [Jerry Weinberg](http://www.geraldmweinberg.com/Site/Home.html)

November's ScotRUG will be a slight departure from our normal technial diet.  Well-known Rubyist and [New Context](http://newcontext.com) Regional Director, [Joe O'Brien](https://twitter.com/objo) will take us on a deep exploration of one or two "People Patterns": patterns for interacting with our customers and colleagues.

These skills are essential for success in your progrmming career - especially if you want to build valuable products, be appreciated, and have your point of view properly acknowledged.  You don't need to be a Rubyist to come along.

19:30 start at the [FreeAgent](http://freeagent.com) offices, [40 Torphichen Street, Edinburgh, EH3 8JB](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=EH3+8JB&hl=en&ll=55.946797,-3.213351&spn=0.009781,0.024226&client=safari&oe=UTF-8&hnear=Edinburgh+EH3+8JB,+United+Kingdom&t=m&z=16&vpsrc=6).
