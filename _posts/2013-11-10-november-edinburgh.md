title: 21st November Edinburgh Meetup - What is ScotRUG and RubyConf roundup
---

Join us at [FreeAgent](http://www.freeagent.com/company/contact-us) for 19:30 for an exciting Edinburgh meetup. First [Paul Wilson](https://twitter.com/paulanthonywils) will give a brief overview of his experience at this year's [RubyConf](http://rubyconf.org) followed by a discussion on the future of ScotRUG (Edinburgh). Let's work out the answers to:-

* What do we want out of ScotRUG? Talks, guest speakers, hacking, our own projects?
* What can we do to make it happen?
* What can we put in place to ensure that it keeps happening?

See you there.
