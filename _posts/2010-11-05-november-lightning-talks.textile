To cheer the dismal November days, come along to ScotRUG at 19:00 on Thursday November 18 to be heartened by cheery lightning talks at the at the usual place: "Edinburgh Training Centre":http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?client=safari&q=EH1+1SU&oe=UTF-8&ie=UTF8&hl=en&hq=&hnear=Edinburgh+EH1+1SU,+United+Kingdom&z=15, 16 St. Marys Street, EH1 1SU.

So far we have:

* "Mark Connell":http://twitter.com/mconnell who will delight us with tales of websockets (with Ruby). You'll laugh.  You'll cry.  You'll receive push notifications of events.

Who else would like to tell us something interesting?  This month, talks can be up to 15 minutes long.  Let us know on "The Google Group":http://groups.google.com/group/scotrug.
