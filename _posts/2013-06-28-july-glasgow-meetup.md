title: Glasgow July 4th RubyCoffee
---
July's Glasgow ScotRUG is going to be a slightly different format from ususal. If you've been along to a LeanAgileGlasgow meetup it will be very familiar.

We are going to borrow the [LeanCoffee format][1]
where we have an informal discussion around the subjects attendees are most interested in.

Hope to see you upstairs from 6:30pm onwards in the [Crystal Palace][2], 36 Jamaica St, Glasgow G1 4QD.
