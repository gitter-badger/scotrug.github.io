* Matt Wynne on the [training wheels coming off cucumber](http://aslakhellesoy.com/post/11055981222/the-training-wheels-came-off)

Do not forget that we'll be meeting at the brand new venue of FreeAgent's new digs, 40 Torphichen Street, Edinburgh, EH3 8JB, It is in the  glass-fronted building on the right hand side of the road, just before the sharp bend if you are walking away from Haymarket.  See the snapshot on Google Maps [here](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=55.947001,-3.212879&spn=0.009781,0.024226&oe=UTF-8&&vpsrc=0&z=16&layer=c&cbll=55.947008,-3.212719&panoid=JgJD7n9AKiopAKiNJon0Aw&cbp=12,166.98,,0,13.97).  There is no FreeAgent signage, but there is a big 40 on the glass.
