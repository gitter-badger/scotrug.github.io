Phil Roberts has just finished a large rewrite of [Float](http://floatapp.com) to be a javascript-heavy front-end based application using
Backbone.js.  Phil will be telling us about the reason for the change, his experiences, and introducing us to Backbone.js.

Usual time (19:30) and the usual place (FreeAgent offices).
