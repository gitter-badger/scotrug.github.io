title: Glasgow September ScotRUG - 06 September 2012
---

September we have [T.J. Sheehy](http://twitter.com/tjsheehy) bringing the wisdom of Charlie Chaplin to Glasgow ruby user group.

Chaplin's Craft:

Charles Chaplin was intimately involved in crafting every part of his movies. His development techniques and approach to story design challenged the popular film making techniques of his day. What are the similarities and differences between Chaplin's film making approach and how we create software? What insights can we gather from his work to help improve our own craft?

As usual it will all take place at [SocietyM](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=societyM+glasgow&ll=55.866125,-4.254284&spn=0.006971,0.01929&hq=societyM&hnear=Glasgow,+Glasgow+City,+United+Kingdom&t=h&z=16) starting at 7pm.

Thanks as always to [New Context](http://newcontext.com) for sponsoring the venue.
