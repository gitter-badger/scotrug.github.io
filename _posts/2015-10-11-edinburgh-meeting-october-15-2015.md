We are going to do lightning talks this Thursday.
If there's a topic you'd like to talk about or something interesting you'd like to show, then come along and share it!

The meeting will take place in [CodeBase](http://www.thisiscodebase.com) at 19:30. We'll be in the Blackford Board Room, on Floor M.

See (/join) the discussion in the [ScotRUG Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!search/scotrug/scotrug/F0DehO7m4zs/8Zk-7tUrAwAJ) for details.
