title: August 2015 meeting -  Austin Ziegler on Ansible and Rails
---

We have a special guest star for August's Edinburgh meeting. [Austin Ziegler](https://twitter.com/halostatue) will be talking about Rails deployment with [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/home).

Austin says

>>  We deploy our Rails applications with Ansible. I can cover what we do in Ansible—with a brief introduction on Ansible—but I can also talk about our slug builder for Ansible-based deploys, Cartage

The meeting will be in [CodeBase](http://www.thisiscodebase.com), in Argyle House on the corner of [West Port and Lady Lawson Street](https://goo.gl/maps/ZuPgH). Start will be at 19:30; signs will guide you to the correct place, but it will probably be the Event Space on Floor L.
