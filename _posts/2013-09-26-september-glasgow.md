We are very pleased to announce that [Matt Wynne](https://twitter.com/mattwynne) will be giving us his Baruco talk 'Treating objects like people' on Thursday the 3rd of October! 


Description:

We all know it's wrong to treat people like objects. 

Have you ever considered what happens when you design your objects to be treated the same way? In this talk Matt explores the intersection between psychology and OO design.

You'll leave with some food for thought about how to model the interactions between your objects, as well as how to relate to the people around you.



As always a big thanks to [Neo](http://neo.com) for sponsoring the venue.
