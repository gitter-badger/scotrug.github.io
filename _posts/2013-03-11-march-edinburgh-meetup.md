title: Mob programming on Thursday 21st Mar, in Edinburgh
---

As suggested by Iain Watt, this month will be all about mob rule. The general idea is that we all work on the same piece of code together.
We'll pick a kata or some such that we can get our teeth into and see how we go. The aim is more to see how others attack a problem
rather than to have something finished and working.

If anyone has any ideas on what problem/kata/Ruby quiz we could have a go at, please email the [google group](mailto:scotrug@googlegroups.com)
