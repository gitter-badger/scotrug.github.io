We are pleased to announce that [Orde Saunders](https://twitter.com/decadecity) will be speaking about Building for the device agnostic web.

__Talk Description:__

We can't control how our users access our websites - they may use mobile phones, TVs, tablets, games consoles, laptops, desktop computers, or even their glasses and their watch! 
In this world, meeting our customers' needs on their terms is a daunting task.

__About Orde__

In 1994 Orde viewed the source of a web page, realised it was just a text file, and thought:  "I wonder if I can build a web page?"  
Since then he's built a lot of web pages but is still looking at things on the internet and thinking: "I wonder if I can build something like that?"
