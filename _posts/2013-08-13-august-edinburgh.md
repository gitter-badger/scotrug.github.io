This Thursday we will be having a couple of talks at ScotRUG:

* Stephen Best will be talking about Dependency Injection in Ruby
* Brian Swan will be previewing his [Lean Agile Scotland](http://www.leanagilescotland.com) talk "Help, my tests are killing me." This talk will examine the characteristics of readability in tests and offer advice on making your tests more readable.
