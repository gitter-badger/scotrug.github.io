title: November meeting - Thursday 17 November 2011
---

November started on a Wednesday, so this month's meeting comes earlier than expected.  This month [Brian Swan](twitter.com/bgswan) will be giving us his take on Rails tests. More details to follow.

Don't forget that the meetin is in our new venue, the wonderful FreeAgent offices.  See [the October post](http://scotrug.org/2011/10/19/october-meeeting.html) for detailed directions.
