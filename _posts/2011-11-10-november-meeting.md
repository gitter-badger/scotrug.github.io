title: November meeting - Thursday 17 November 2011
---

November started on a Wednesday, so this month's meeting comes earlier than expected.  This month we have two talks 

* [Brian Swan](http://twitter.com/bgswan) will be giving us his take on Rails tests. Expect controversy and challenges to the new orthodoxies.
* [Thomas Haggett](http://twitter.com/#!/thomashaggett) will be talking about how he has successfully used [Puppet and MCollective](http://puppetlabs.com/mcollective/) at FreeAgent, with patterns and suggestions to take away.

Don't forget that the meetin is in our new venue, the wonderful FreeAgent offices.  See [the October post](/2011/10/19/october-meeeting.html) for detailed directions.

*Updated 15 Nov 2011*: added Thomas' talk.
