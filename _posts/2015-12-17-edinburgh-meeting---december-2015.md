title: Edinburgh Meeting - 17 December 2015
---

Following on from a suggestion at last month's Lean Coffee, we're going to watch a recording of the talk [Nothing is Something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMPfEXIlTVE) by [Sandi Metz](http://www.sandimetz.com).

We'll have a discussion afterwards.

We'll be in [CodeBase](http://www.thisiscodebase.com/) from 19:30.  Head up to Floor L and we'll be in the Nor Loch room.
