title: September 15, 2011 - Let's make stuff
---

Suggested by [Matt Wynne](http://twitter.com/mattwyne), September's meetup is going to be all about making stuff. We will kick off the session with 5 minute presentations by people with project ideas, then we will break up into groups and start working on the project.  We've already had a few ideas suggested on the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/scotrug?hl=en).

* [Matt Wynne](http://twitter.com/mattwynne) wants to make a start on a test-based dynamic analysis tool for Ruby, [DARTS](https://github.com/mattwynne/darts).
* [Sam Elliot](http://twitter.com/github) wants some helping hands with [Ruby Pair](http://rubypair.com/)
* [Drew Neil](http://twitter.com/nelstrom) has an idea of applying [Doctor JS](https://github.com/mozilla/doctorjs), Mozilla's Javascript Static Analysis tool to Coffeescript.

Come along, bring an idea and/or willingness to help and take part.
