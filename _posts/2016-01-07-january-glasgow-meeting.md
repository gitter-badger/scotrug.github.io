We are meeting up for the first time this year from **18:30** on
**Thursday 7 January** at the CCA.  Details and a map to the venue are
on the
[Open Tech Calendar event page](https://opentechcalendar.co.uk/event/3545-glasgow-ruby-group).

We’ll find a table in the courtyard café downstairs, on the right past
the shop as you walk in from the Sauchiehall Street entrance.  See you
there!
