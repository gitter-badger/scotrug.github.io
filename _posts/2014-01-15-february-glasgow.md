We are very pleased to announce that [Ashley Baxter](https://twitter.com/iamashley) will be speaking about, well.... I'll let Ashley explain.

__Talk Description:__

"Finding myself in the sudden position of running an established business at the age of 18, with no prior experience or knowledge of the industry, I share my experience of teaching myself the necessary skills to run a web-based business, learning to code and bringing a web app to market, and trying to steer it in a new direction altogether."

__About Ashley:__

"An unusual combination of insurer and photographer, Ashley's big girl's job is running insurance broker, Brokers Direct. She has also been known to photograph weddings under the Girl With A Camera alias. Ashley reserves what little time she has for Xbox, weightlifting and convincing people that working in insurance isn't as mundane as it sounds."


We seem to have made the [Fuzzy Orange offices](http://fuzzyorange.co.uk/) office our new home and we quite like it. You can find it at,
