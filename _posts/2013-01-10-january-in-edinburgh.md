[Graeme](https://twitter.com/mathie) is giving a talk on connecting your browser to your message queue with [Server-sent events](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events), which are simpler than Websockets but unidirectional.

19:30 start at the [FreeAgent](http://freeagent.com) offices, [40 Torphichen Street, Edinburgh, EH3 8JB](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=EH3+8JB&hl=en&ll=55.946797,-3.213351&spn=0.009781,0.024226&client=safari&oe=UTF-8&hnear=Edinburgh+EH3+8JB,+United+Kingdom&t=m&z=16&vpsrc=6).
