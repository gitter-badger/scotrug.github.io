title: Graeme Mathieson (Mathie) on Server-sent Events - Glasgow - Thursday 7th February
---

In February we are very luck to have [Graeme](https://twitter.com/mathie) bringing his successful Server-sent Events talk to Glasgow. In the talk Graeme will discuss connecting your browser to your message queue with [Server-sent events](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events), which are simpler than Websockets but unidirectional.

18:30, for 19:00 start at the [SocietyM](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=societyM+glasgow&ll=55.866125,-4.254284&spn=0.006971,0.01929&hq=societyM&hnear=Glasgow,+Glasgow+City,+United+Kingdom&t=h&z=16)

See you in February
