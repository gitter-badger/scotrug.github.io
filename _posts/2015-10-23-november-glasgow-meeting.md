Thursday 5 November 2015 marks the return of regular Ruby meetings to
Glasgow!

This month we will be at the
[CCA Saramango Caf√© Bar](http://www.cca-glasgow.com/saramago-caf/saramago-caf-bar)
on Sauchiehall Street from 19:00.

As this is the first Glasgow meetup for a while, this will be a chance
to talk Ruby with new and seasoned developers, get to know the local
Ruby community, and decide on what we want to get from future
meetings.
