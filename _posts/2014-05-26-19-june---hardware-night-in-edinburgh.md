title: 19 June - Hardware night in Edinburgh
---

June we're having hardware night in Edinburgh. Let's get some LEDs blinking, and maybe other things. Possible topics:

* Getting setup with Arduino
* Making LEDs flash
* Ruby Arduino gems
* Rubuto

If you're coming, [let us know on Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2014/editing-scotrug-edinburgh-june/). Also please bring Arduinos, jumper wires, 10k leds, Raspberry PIs, if you have them. It would be great to hear about your hardware projects, too.
