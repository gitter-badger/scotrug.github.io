title: 19 June - Hardware night in Edinburgh
---

June we're having hardware night in Edinburgh. Let's get some LEDs blinking, other things.

Topics will include:

* Dan Muncton demonstrating controlling Arduinos with Ruby / Rubuto
* Getting setup with Arduino
* Hardware hacking with the Raspberry PI (James Robertson)
* Making your own "Arduinos", for Â£4 or less. Paul Wilson with some [Shrimp kits](http://shrimping.it/blog/shrimp-kit/) that you can play with.
* Making LEDs flash
* Ruby Arduino gems
* Rubuto

If you're coming, [let us know on Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2014/editing-scotrug-edinburgh-june/). James, Dan, and I will bring in some hardware, but bring in your own jumpers cables, leds, breadboards, etc... if you have them.

It would be great to hear about your hardware projects, too.
