Those lovely people at [FreeAgent](http://www.freeagentcentral.com/) have offered to host Edinburgh ScotRUG meetings at their fabulous new offices, near Haymarket station.  They have even said that they may be able to provide us with a beer or two in their offices.  The first meeting in this location will be on 20 October, 2011. (If their sofa reminds you of anything, best not to mention it though.)

The new venue is 40 Torphichen Street, Edinburgh, EH3 8JB, or <a href="http://bit.ly/oyuycK">here</a> on Google Maps.
