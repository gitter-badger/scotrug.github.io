        <h2 >About</h2>
        <p>The
          Scottish Ruby User Group is a collection of people who are linked with
          Scotland and have an interest in Ruby and, invariably, Ruby on Rails.
          We meet every month for presentations from members and guests and a chat about Ruby and Ruby Related events. Everybody is
          welcome and there are no subscriptions/costs involved.</p>

        <p>We now also have an IRC channel available. It’s pretty quiet at the

  <div class='date'>posted 04 Aug 2011</div>
  <div class='body'><p><em>UPDATE</em>: <a href='http://twitter.com/lenary'>Sam Elliot</a> won the contest by a long nose with the code <a href='https://gist.github.com/f07721b1d116a3129c9c'>here</a>.</p>

<p>Another month, another exciting meeting. This month <a href='http://chatley.com'>Robert Chatley</a> and <a href='http://twitter.com/mattwynne'>Matt Wynne</a> will be running their Extreme Startup session, <a href='http://chatley.com/posts/05-27-2011/extreme-startup/'>first shown at XP2011</a>. Here&#8217;s the gen from Robert:</p>

<h1 id='extreme_startup'>Extreme Startup</h1>

<p>In this hands-on workshop we aim to simulate product teams building software and delivering it into a market. Attendees form teams and compete to build the best product. Through the session you can continue to refine and upgrade your software, releasing new versions and testing their performance in the market. Once your software is live it will begin to accrue points, as simulated users use the software and score it against how well it fits their needs. The earlier you release your software, the sooner you will start accruing points, and the earlier you can learn something about the market, which should inform your next iteration. In the lean startup movement, this is know as the Build-Measure-Learn cycle.</p>

<p>Attendees of this session will need to build a very simple webapp, probably as part of a pair or a small team, so you will need at least one laptop per team.</p>

<p>So that we can get started quickly, it would be helpful if participants could do a little bit of preparatory work. Set up a minimal webapp running locally on your machine that handles a GET request, with a request param &#8216;q&#8217;, (e.g. http://localhost:4567/?q=Adam) and returns a plain text response. For example, using Sinatra:</p>

<pre><code>require &#39;rubygems&#39;
require &#39;sinatra&#39;

configure do
  set :port, 4567
end

get &#39;/&#39; do
  q = params[:q]
  &quot;Hello #{q}&quot;
end</code></pre>

<p>We will be at the usual place, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?client=safari&amp;q=EH1+1SU&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Edinburgh+EH1+1SU,+United+Kingdom&amp;z=15'>The Edinburgh Training Centre</a> on Thursday 18th August, starting at 19:30 sharp. Please try and be a little early.</p></div>
