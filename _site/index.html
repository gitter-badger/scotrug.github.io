            <div class='date'>posted 16 Jun 2012</div>
            <div class='body'><p>June&#8217;s ScotRUG will be a a sneak-preview of a couple of <a href='http://scottishrubyconference.com/'>Scottish Ruby Conference</a> talks. Talks will be limited to 35 minutes; save your questions and feedback until afterwards.</p>

              <h1 id='shadowboxing_your_way_to_a_secure_application_by_rory_mccune'>Shadowboxing your way to a secure application, by Rory McCune</h1>

              <p>There are a number of potential approaches that developers and testers can take to reviewing the security of their applications and a growing number of tools to help the process along.</p>

              <p>&#8220;Traditional&#8221; black box web application scanners and static analysis tools (aka white box tools) both have pros and cons in terms of things they will find and more importantly, things that they won’t.</p>

              <p>This talk aims to review the ups and downs of both approaches and specific ruby based tools that can be used as part of the process. It will also highlight some areas where good old manual review is still key.</p>

              <h1 id='how_we_learn_a_language_by_ryan_stenhouse'>How we learn a language by Ryan Stenhouse</h1>

              <p>We all use language in fun and interesting ways, even when we don’t think about it. Our industry brings us together with people from all over the world, even some of the folks attending this conference will speak English as a second or even third language.</p>

              <p>In a past life I was a teacher of english as a foreign language, and these days I’ve kept that passion for languages alive by becoming multilingual myself.</p>

              <p>I’ll speak about how we pick up a programming language in much the same way as we learn to speak a natural language and then integrate ourselves in the culture surrounding that programming language in much the same way.</p>

              <p>I’m not going to talk at boring lengths about language theory, but instead evaluate how we learn a language as humans – regardless of its origin. I hope to make it clear that you can apply some of – if not all – the same skills you use to easily pick up a new programming language to give you a real leg-up in learning a foreign language.</p>

              <p>You’ll never think about abstraction or obfuscation in exactly the same way again, and hopefully leave with a desire to test my assertion and learn another language, and that would be just great.  Why would I want to do this? Well, I’m biased but I truly believe that the world would be a better place if people understood each other better – and that means more people becoming multilingual.</p></div>

            <div class='body'><p>Suggested by <a href='http://twitter.com/mattwyne'>Matt Wynne</a>, September&#8217;s meetup is going to be all about making stuff. We will kick off the session with 5 minute presentations by people with project ideas, then we will break up into groups and start working on the project. We&#8217;ve already had a few ideas suggested on the <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/scotrug?hl=en'>mailing list</a>.</p>

              <ul>
                <li><a href='http://twitter.com/mattwynne'>Matt Wynne</a> wants to make a start on a test-based dynamic analysis tool for Ruby, <a href='https://github.com/mattwynne/darts'>DARTS</a>.</li>

                <li><a href='http://twitter.com/github'>Sam Elliot</a> wants some helping hands with <a href='http://rubypair.com/'>Ruby Pair</a></li>

                <li><a href='http://twitter.com/nelstrom'>Drew Neil</a> has an idea of applying <a href='https://github.com/mozilla/doctorjs'>Doctor JS</a>, Mozilla&#8217;s Javascript Static Analysis tool to Coffeescript.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Come along, bring an idea and/or willingness to help and take part.</p>

            <div class='date'>posted 04 Aug 2011</div>
            <div class='body'><p><em>UPDATE</em>: <a href='http://twitter.com/lenary'>Sam Elliot</a> won the contest by a long nose with the code <a href='https://gist.github.com/f07721b1d116a3129c9c'>here</a>.</p>

              <p>Another month, another exciting meeting. This month <a href='http://chatley.com'>Robert Chatley</a> and <a href='http://twitter.com/mattwynne'>Matt Wynne</a> will be running their Extreme Startup session, <a href='http://chatley.com/posts/05-27-2011/extreme-startup/'>first shown at XP2011</a>. Here&#8217;s the gen from Robert:</p>

              <h1 id='extreme_startup'>Extreme Startup</h1>

              <p>In this hands-on workshop we aim to simulate product teams building software and delivering it into a market. Attendees form teams and compete to build the best product. Through the session you can continue to refine and upgrade your software, releasing new versions and testing their performance in the market. Once your software is live it will begin to accrue points, as simulated users use the software and score it against how well it fits their needs. The earlier you release your software, the sooner you will start accruing points, and the earlier you can learn something about the market, which should inform your next iteration. In the lean startup movement, this is know as the Build-Measure-Learn cycle.</p>

              <p>Attendees of this session will need to build a very simple webapp, probably as part of a pair or a small team, so you will need at least one laptop per team.</p>

              <p>So that we can get started quickly, it would be helpful if participants could do a little bit of preparatory work. Set up a minimal webapp running locally on your machine that handles a GET request, with a request param &#8216;q&#8217;, (e.g. http://localhost:4567/?q=Adam) and returns a plain text response. For example, using Sinatra:</p>

<pre><code>require &#39;rubygems&#39;
require &#39;sinatra&#39;

configure do
  set :port, 4567
end

get &#39;/&#39; do
  q = params[:q]
  &quot;Hello #{q}&quot;
end</code></pre>

              <p>We will be at the usual place, <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?client=safari&amp;q=EH1+1SU&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Edinburgh+EH1+1SU,+United+Kingdom&amp;z=15'>The Edinburgh Training Centre</a> on Thursday 18th August, starting at 19:30 sharp. Please try and be a little early.</p></div>
