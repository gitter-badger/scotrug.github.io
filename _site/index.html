  <h2><a href='/2014/10/07/october-in-edinburgh.html'>16th October Edinburgh Meetup</a></h2>
  <div class='date'>posted 07 Oct 2014</div>
  <div class='body'><p>It&#8217;s going to be an interesting meetup with two speakers so far.</p>

<p><strong>Pets, Cattle and Cloned Sheep</strong></p>

<p><a href='https://twitter.com/semanticist'>John Daniels</a> will be giving a lightning talk version of <strong><a href='http://container.camp/talks/pets_cattle_cloned_sheep/'>&#8220;Pets, Cattle and Cloned Sheep&#8221;</a></strong> about Docker.</p>

<p>There was alot of discussion about virtualisation at the last meetup, which trickled onto the mailing list, so it&#8217;ll be great to hear more about Docker.</p>

<p>At this point you&#8217;re probably thinking &#8220;Docker sounds really useful, but who in their right mind would trust me to use it?&#8221;. Well&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>&#8220;WHAT&#8217;S THE WORST THAT CAN HAPPEN?&#8221; - Enabling authentic trust at work</strong></p>

<p><a href='https://twitter.com/somesheep'>Marc Burgauer</a> will be talking about trust:</p>

<p><em>Teaser</em></p>

<p>Trust is the metric that best reflects the quality of our relationships and of our social connections. Without trust, organisational improvements efforts cannot flourish. We reliably find the absence of trust is the cause for teams failing to adopt agile or lean practices successfully. How can trust be developed to support successful adoption?</p>

<p>We&#8217;re physically hardwired for connection. Rejection hurts. We get meaning and validation where connection allows us to be authentic. Yet we exist in environments that routinely inform us, that what we do and who we are, is not &#8220;Good Enough&#8221;. We are shamed into conformity (often masqueraded as improvement) and blamed for failures.</p>

<p>&#8220;Management, in most of its incarnations, is an institutionalized form of distrust&#8221; say Robert Solomon and Fernando Flores.</p>

<p>This talk explores how we can remain authentic in a blame culture; how we can build authentic trust and enable safe-to-fail environments to strengthen our connections, as well as my own experience applying these practices.</p>

<p><em>Bio</em></p>

<p>It&#8217;s Marc&#8217;s first time at ScotRUG Edinburgh, so here&#8217;s an ice-breaker:</p>

<p>Marc Burgauer has experienced professional life as a biologist, an award-winning performance artist and musician, enterprise database architect and early web applications programmer, founder, board member and manager in multiple startups, project manager and coach in multinationals and public services.</p>

<p>Complexity theory defined Marc&#8217;s worldview early in life. He quotes Erich Jantsch&#8217;s “The Self-organizing Universe” as the pivotal book that he read as a teenager. Marc’s interest in theories about work, including his acclaim of Peter Drucker, was re-ignited when he first adopted XP in 1999.</p>

<p>For the last 15 years, Marc has been keen to test ideas and, as a practitioner, enjoys the application of theories in day-to-day work.</p>

<p>Marc currently focuses his studies on innovation and cultural change while, as a consultant, he encourages organizations to adopt lean and agile practices.</p>

<p><strong>Venue</strong></p>

<p><strong>New to ScotRUG?</strong></p>

<p>ScotRUG is an informal meetup. Different people tend to turn up each month, both regular attendees and new people.</p>

<p>Some people have done alot of Ruby and some people are just curious. If you fall into any of these groups, just come along!</p>

<p>The meeting usually wraps up about 9pm, although sometimes some people head to a nearby tavern afterwards to continue the discussion.</p></div>

<p><strong>Talk Description:</strong></p>

<p>Go faster applications</p>

<p>Ruby is a great programming language to write expressive, easy to read code that has thousands apon thousands of libraries to choose from so you don&#8217;t have to write any code.</p>

<p>But Ruby has one major issue, it is slow language and it comes to a point where you need to augment your Ruby code with another languge. Github used Erlang, Twitter used Scala but for me the choice is Go.</p>

<p>In this talk I&#8217;ll look at why I&#8217;ve Go over other programming languages, what&#8217;s been gained, what&#8217;s been lost and how you can integrate Go applications with existing Ruby apps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Finding myself in the sudden position of running an established business at the age of 18, with no prior experience or knowledge of the industry, I share my experience of teaching myself the necessary skills to run a web-based business, learning to code and bringing a web app to market, and trying to steer it in a new direction altogether.&#8221;</p>

  <div class='body'><p>We are very pleased to announce that <a href='https://twitter.com/thebestie'>Stephen Best (Bestie)</a> will be travelling all the way from London especially to speak to us and as a special treat we&#8217;ll be putting on some pizza and refreshments!</p>

<p><strong>Talk Description:</strong></p>

<p>Most of us have heard the vague, hand waving spiel about why DI is important for writing flexible, reusable code, a little harder to come by are examples of how one actually goes about doing it in a (cost) effective manner.</p>

<p>Rather than a dry introduction to DI, this talk will be packed full of code examples demonstrating practical techniques you can start using straight away, no gems, meta-programming or magic required. We&#8217;ll also explore how you might persuade your Rails app to benefit from DI.</p>

<p><strong>About Stephen:</strong></p>

<p>Bestie is a London based Ruby / Javascript / XP contractor, committed to software craftsman and OO design obsessive.</p>

<p>This month we have a new venue at the <a href='http://fuzzyorange.co.uk/'>Fuzzy Orange offices</a>, which are at the Pentagon Centre, Unit 313, Glasgow, G3 8AZ</p>

<p>Start time is 6:30 for 7pm.</p>

<p>Look forward to seeing you there <a href='https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=G3+8AZ&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=53.800651,-4.064941&amp;sspn=15.822054,30.080566&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=Glasgow+G3+8AZ,+United+Kingdom&amp;z=17'>Map</a></p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>We all know it&#8217;s wrong to treat people like objects.</p>

<p>Have you ever considered what happens when you design your objects to be treated the same way? In this talk Matt explores the intersection between psychology and OO design.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll leave with some food for thought about how to model the interactions between your objects, as well as how to relate to the people around you.</p>

  <div class='date'>posted 18 Oct 2012</div>
  <div class='body'><p>This month is a Extreme Startup again. See below for the description from <a href='http://xp2011.org/content.apthisId=185&amp;contentId=184'>XP 2012</a>.</p>

<h1 id='extreme_startup'>Extreme Startup</h1>

<p>In this hands-on workshop we aim to simulate product teams building software and delivering it into a market. Attendees form teams and compete to build the best product. Through the session you can continue to refine and upgrade your software, releasing new versions and testing their performance in the market. Once your software is live it will begin to accrue points, as simulated users use the software and score it against how well it fits their needs. The earlier you release your software, the sooner you will start accruing points, and the earlier you can learn something about the market, which should inform your next iteration. In the lean startup movement, this is know as the Build-Measure-Learn cycle.</p>

<p>Attendees of this session will need to build a very simple webapp, probably as part of a pair or a small team, so you will need at least one laptop per team.</p>

<p>So that we can get started quickly, it would be helpful if participants could do a little bit of preparatory work. Set up a minimal webapp running locally on your machine that handles a GET request, with a request param &#8216;q&#8217;, (e.g. http://localhost:4567/?q=Adam) and returns a plain text response. For example, using Sinatra:</p>

<pre><code>require &#39;rubygems&#39;
require &#39;sinatra&#39;

configure do
  set :port, 4567
end

get &#39;/&#39; do
  q = params[:q]
  &quot;Hello #{q}&quot;
end</code></pre></div>

  <div class='body'><p>For the October meetup <a href='http://twitter.com/wattid'>Iain Watt</a> will be expanding on his Scot Ruby Conf lightening talk.</p>

<h3 id='bio'>Bio:</h3>

<p>Being brought up in the 70&#8217;s on a diet of Horizon &amp; Tomorrows World I was always going to be interested in tech. I got my first proper hands-on exposure to tech with a BBC micro and haven&#8217;t looked back since. IBM and Compaq paid me to play with robotics, material handling systems, and manufacturing data collection &amp; reporting systems - to build new stuff or to make things better. Fortunately I love to learn so that I can build new stuff or make things better but I hate it when something (particularly IT) doesn&#8217;t work the way I want it to.</p>

<h3 id='talk'>Talk:</h3>

<p>&#8220;The most important book you&#8217;ve never read, or possibly even heard of&#8221; I&#8217;ll introduce you to a handful of what Dr. John Medina, a developmental molecular biologist and affiliate Professor of Bioengineering at the University of Washington School of Medicine, intriguingly terms &#8220;Brain Rules&#8221;. In the book Brain Rules: 12 Principles for Surviving and Thriving at Work, Home, and School, Medina explains, why we might want to re-evaluate our approach to our environments and to our practices in education, at work and at home to get the best from the most powerful tool we have at our disposal - our brain - and to harness the latest research findings to improve our learning capabilities. If you&#8217;re in any way interested in learning about learning and getting better at the things that interest you, come along to hear my talk. Hopefully I will convince you to go buy the book. Is it &#8220;The most important book you&#8217;ve never read, or possibly even heard of&#8221;? Probably.</p>

  <div class='body'><p>September we have <a href='http://twitter.com/tjsheehy'>T.J. Sheehy</a> bringing the wisdom of Charlie Chaplin to Glasgow ruby user group.</p>

<p>Chaplin&#8217;s Craft:</p>

<p>Charles Chaplin was intimately involved in crafting every part of his movies. His development techniques and approach to story design challenged the popular film making techniques of his day. What are the similarities and differences between Chaplin&#8217;s film making approach and how we create software? What insights can we gather from his work to help improve our own craft?</p>

<p>As usual it will all take place at <a href='https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=societyM+glasgow&amp;ll=55.866125,-4.254284&amp;spn=0.006971,0.01929&amp;hq=societyM&amp;hnear=Glasgow,+Glasgow+City,+United+Kingdom&amp;t=h&amp;z=16'>SocietyM</a> starting at 7pm.</p>

  <div class='date'>posted 16 Jun 2012</div>
  <div class='body'><p>June&#8217;s ScotRUG will be a a sneak-preview of a couple of <a href='http://scottishrubyconference.com/'>Scottish Ruby Conference</a> talks. Talks will be limited to 35 minutes; save your questions and feedback until afterwards.</p>

<h1 id='shadowboxing_your_way_to_a_secure_application_by_rory_mccune'>Shadowboxing your way to a secure application, by Rory McCune</h1>

<p>There are a number of potential approaches that developers and testers can take to reviewing the security of their applications and a growing number of tools to help the process along.</p>

<p>&#8220;Traditional&#8221; black box web application scanners and static analysis tools (aka white box tools) both have pros and cons in terms of things they will find and more importantly, things that they won’t.</p>

<p>This talk aims to review the ups and downs of both approaches and specific ruby based tools that can be used as part of the process. It will also highlight some areas where good old manual review is still key.</p>

<h1 id='how_we_learn_a_language_by_ryan_stenhouse'>How we learn a language by Ryan Stenhouse</h1>

<p>We all use language in fun and interesting ways, even when we don’t think about it. Our industry brings us together with people from all over the world, even some of the folks attending this conference will speak English as a second or even third language.</p>

<p>In a past life I was a teacher of english as a foreign language, and these days I’ve kept that passion for languages alive by becoming multilingual myself.</p>

<p>I’ll speak about how we pick up a programming language in much the same way as we learn to speak a natural language and then integrate ourselves in the culture surrounding that programming language in much the same way.</p>

<p>I’m not going to talk at boring lengths about language theory, but instead evaluate how we learn a language as humans – regardless of its origin. I hope to make it clear that you can apply some of – if not all – the same skills you use to easily pick up a new programming language to give you a real leg-up in learning a foreign language.</p>

<p>You’ll never think about abstraction or obfuscation in exactly the same way again, and hopefully leave with a desire to test my assertion and learn another language, and that would be just great.  Why would I want to do this? Well, I’m biased but I truly believe that the world would be a better place if people understood each other better – and that means more people becoming multilingual.</p></div>

<p>Another month, another exciting meeting. This month <a href='http://chatley.com'>Robert Chatley</a> and <a href='http://twitter.com/mattwynne'>Matt Wynne</a> will be running their Extreme Startup session, <a href='http://chatley.com/posts/05-27-2011/extreme-startup/'>first shown at XP2011</a>. Here&#8217;s the gen from Robert:</p>

<h1 id='extreme_startup'>Extreme Startup</h1>

<p>In this hands-on workshop we aim to simulate product teams building software and delivering it into a market. Attendees form teams and compete to build the best product. Through the session you can continue to refine and upgrade your software, releasing new versions and testing their performance in the market. Once your software is live it will begin to accrue points, as simulated users use the software and score it against how well it fits their needs. The earlier you release your software, the sooner you will start accruing points, and the earlier you can learn something about the market, which should inform your next iteration. In the lean startup movement, this is know as the Build-Measure-Learn cycle.</p>

<p>Attendees of this session will need to build a very simple webapp, probably as part of a pair or a small team, so you will need at least one laptop per team.</p>

<p>So that we can get started quickly, it would be helpful if participants could do a little bit of preparatory work. Set up a minimal webapp running locally on your machine that handles a GET request, with a request param &#8216;q&#8217;, (e.g. http://localhost:4567/?q=Adam) and returns a plain text response. For example, using Sinatra:</p>

<pre><code>require &#39;rubygems&#39;
require &#39;sinatra&#39;

configure do
  set :port, 4567
end

get &#39;/&#39; do
  q = params[:q]
  &quot;Hello #{q}&quot;
end</code></pre>

  <div class='date'>posted 02 Jun 2011</div>
  <div class='body'><p>The June meeting is going to be a bit special &#8211; the first in a new European Speaker Exchange Programme masterminded by the <a href="http://www.rug-b.de/">Berlin Ruby User Group</a>.  Martin Rehfeld will be talking about the lessons learned developing his new service <a href="http://www.assets.io">Assets.io</a> featuring dynamic Javascript and <span class="caps">CSS</span> delivery through the Amazon Cloudfront <span class="caps">CDN</span>.  Other parts include a custom backend using evented Ruby code (Thin/Async Rack/Eventmachine).  It promises to be an exciting meeting, and in due course we&#8217;ll be catapulting one of our own speakers over the North Sea to Berlin.  Martin will be in Edinburgh from June 14 to June 17, so let&#8217;s all make him welcome.</p>
<p>We will be at the usual place, <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?client=safari&amp;q=EH1+1SU&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Edinburgh+EH1+1SU,+United+Kingdom&amp;z=15">The Edinburgh Training Centre</a> on Thursday 16 June.</p>
<p>The speaker exchange programme is looking for some sponsorship, particularly to cover Martin&#8217;s cost. If your company can help, get in touch via the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/usergroup-speaker-exchange">Google Group</a> or email paul [{at}] edgecase.com.</p></div>

  <div class='body'><p>I&#8217;ve made a small step towards making the ScotRUG site more maintabable, and giving us a little bit of history.  I have converted it to <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>.  It is still not very pretty, but we can work on that.  The source is on GitHub <a href="http://github.com/paulanthonywilson/ScotRUG">here</a>.  For now, if anyone wants to make it a bit nicer, please fork and send me a pull request.</p></div>
