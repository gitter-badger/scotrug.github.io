<p>I&#8217;ve made a small step towards making the ScotRUG site more maintabable, and giving us a little bit of history.  I have converted it to <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>.  It is still not very pretty, but we can work on that.  The source is on GitHub <a href="http://github.com/paulanthonywilson/ScotRUG">here</a>.  For now, if anyone wants to make it a bit nicer, please fork and send me a pull request.</p>
