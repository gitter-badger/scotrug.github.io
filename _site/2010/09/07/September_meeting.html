<p>By popular demand the next meeting will be an interactive session on <a href="http://rubykoans.com/">Ruby Koans</a>.  Bring your laptops for some fun coding.  Kickoff will be at 19:30 with a walkthrough.  Then we will pair up and code through some more.  We will have a debrief at the end followed (no doubt) by a visit to the Holyrood Tavern.</p>
