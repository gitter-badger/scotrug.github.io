  <h2><a href='/2014/02/05/february-glasgow.html'>Glasgow, WEDNESDAY 5th February 2014</a></h2>
  <div class='date'>posted 05 Feb 2014</div>
  <div class='body'><p>We are very pleased to announce that <a href='https://twitter.com/iamashley'>Ashley Baxter</a> will be speaking about, well&#8230;. I&#8217;ll let Ashley explain.</p>

<p><strong>Talk Description:</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;Finding myself in the sudden position of running an established business at the age of 18, with no prior experience or knowledge of the industry, I share my experience of teaching myself the necessary skills to run a web-based business, learning to code and bringing a web app to market, and trying to steer it in a new direction altogether.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>About Ashley:</strong></p>

<p>An unusual combination of insurer and photographer, Ashley&#8217;s big girl&#8217;s job is running insurance broker, Brokers Direct. She has also been known to photograph weddings under the Girl With A Camera alias. Ashley reserves what little time she has for Xbox, weightlifting and convincing people that working in insurance isn&#8217;t as mundane as it sounds.</p>

<p>We seem to have made the <a href='http://fuzzyorange.co.uk/'>Fuzzy Orange offices</a> office our new home and we quite like it. You can find it at, Pentagon Centre, Unit 313, Glasgow, G3 8AZ</p>

<p>Start time is 6:30 for 7pm, on Wednesday the 5th of February.</p>

<p>Look forward to seeing you there <a href='https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=G3+8AZ&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=53.800651,-4.064941&amp;sspn=15.822054,30.080566&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=Glasgow+G3+8AZ,+United+Kingdom&amp;z=17'>Map</a></p>

<p>Thanks to <a href='http://neo.com'>Neo</a> and <a href='http://fuzzyorange.co.uk/'>Fuzzy Orange</a> for sponsoring the event.</p>

<p>Remember the to keep up with announcments on <a href='https://twitter.com/scotrug'>Twitter</a> and join the discussion on the <a href='mailto:scotrug@googlegroups.com'>mailing list</a>.</p></div>
