			<div class="entrytext">				<p>The
Scottish Ruby User Group is a collection of people who are linked with
Scotland and have an interest in Ruby and, invariably, Ruby on Rails.
We meet every month to have an informal chat about all things Ruby,
occasionally with presentations from members and guests. Everybody is
welcome and there are no subscriptions/costs involved. It’s just an
informal chat over a beer with likeminded Rubyists.</p>
<h3>Meetings</h3>
<p>Unless something in particular has been organised, we meet on the
third Thursday of the month from around 19:00 onwards, at&nbsp;Milnes
Bar,&nbsp;35 Hanover Street, Edinburgh (<a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=milne+bar+edinburgh&amp;sll=53.800651,-4.064941&amp;sspn=12.478806,33.09082&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=55.954654,-3.196635&amp;spn=0.011533,0.032315&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=A">google map</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;An
area in room off to the side of the bar downstairs is usually booked
for the meeting, so there will be plenty of space, food available and,
of course, lovely beer. Everybody is welcome, and there is no need to
register/let us know in advance. Just turn up and look for likely
Rubyists.</p>
<h4>Next Meeting</h4>
<p>The next meeting is joining forces with Tech Meetup. We’ll be
meeting on Wednesday 14th January, from 18:30 on the 8th floor of
Appleton Tower, Crichton Street, Edinburgh. Graeme will be giving an
introduction to Ruby on Rails to the rest of the Tech Meetup crew.
There will also be beer and pizza on hand!</p>
<h3>Mailing List / Google Group</h3>
<p>You can subscribe to the mailing list using the&nbsp;<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/scotrug">ScotRUG Google Group information page</a>. The list is for announcements of&nbsp;<strong>ScotRUG</strong>&nbsp;activities
and general support/discussion about Ruby (and Ruby on Rails!). Feel
free to post any questions you have; we’re an open and friendly
community. As of the last time I checked, the mailing list has around
75 members.</p>
<h3>IRC group</h3>
<p>We now also have an IRC channel available. It’s pretty quiet at the
moment, but I’m sure we’ll pick up a number of idlers now that it’s
been announced. You can find us on <code>irc.freenode.net</code>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<code>#<strong>scotrug</strong></code>.</p>
