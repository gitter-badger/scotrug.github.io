Scottish Ruby User Group is a collection of people who are linked with
Scotland and have an interest in Ruby and, invariably, Ruby on Rails.
We meet every month for presentations from members and guests and a chat about Ruby and Ruby Related events. Everybody is
welcome and there are no subscriptions/costs involved.</p>
<h3>Meetings</h3>
<p>We meet on the
third Thursday of the month at 19:30 onwards, at The Edinburgh Training Centre, 16 St. Marys Street, Edinburgh, EH1 1SU (<a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?client=safari&q=EH1+1SU&oe=UTF-8&ie=UTF8&hl=en&hq=&hnear=Edinburgh+EH1+1SU,+United+Kingdom&z=15">Google map</a>).  The meeting room costs are covered by <a href="http://www.freeagentcentral.com/">FreeAgent Central</a>, who provide online Accounting Software for freelancers and small businesses (written in Rails). </p>
<h4>Next Meeting</h4>
<p>With one week to go until the <a href="http://scottrishrubyconference.com">Scottish Ruby Conference</a>, the current plan for the next meeting is for an informal pub session in the Holyrood Tavern, 9A Holyrood Road, Edinburgh, EH8 8AE (<a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?client=safari&oe=UTF-8&ie=UTF8&q=the+holyrood+edinburgh&fb=1&gl=uk&hq=the+holyrood&hnear=edinburgh&cid=0,0,11142680372521283372&ei=7K6JS8exEZWI0wTih-nPCw&ved=0CBEQnwIwAA&ll=55.951002,-3.182731&spn=0.011341,0.026822&z=15">Google map</a>).  We will meet there from about 19:30 on Thursday 18 March.</p>
<h3>Mailing List / Google Group</h3>
<p>You can subscribe to the mailing list using the&nbsp;<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/scotrug">ScotRUG Google Group information page</a>. The list is for announcements of&nbsp;<strong>ScotRUG</strong>&nbsp;activities
and general support/discussion about Ruby (and Ruby on Rails!). Feel
free to post any questions you have; we’re an open and friendly
community. As of the last time I checked, the mailing list has around
75 members.</p>
<h3>Video</h3>

<p>Videos of previous presentations, provided courtesy of <a href="http://edgecase.com">EdgeCase UK</a>, are available <a href="http://vimeo.com/edgecaseuk">here</a>.</p> 

<h3>IRC group</h3>
<p>We now also have an IRC channel available. It’s pretty quiet at the
moment, but I’m sure we’ll pick up a number of idlers now that it’s
been announced. You can find us on <code>irc.freenode.net</code>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<code>#<strong>scotrug</strong></code>.</p>
